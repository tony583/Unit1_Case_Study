* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    * I have dealt with SocietyOne and Rate Setter in the past and have friends working in the Fintech industry and lending money to investors in the property industry. I found MoneyMe interesting because of its infrastructure and the range of products they offer, and the fact they are a listed company.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    *   MoneyMe co-founders realized that the current personal loan providers are slow-moving corporate that the big four banks in Australia mostly represent. They have used machine learning to offer personal loans to millennial Australians to solve this problem, and they claim that loans can be approved within minutes!

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    * MoneyMe says it created its own Ai Technology, called Aiden. It also claims that the AI can predict customer behavior and adjust its risk management based on the information.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    * I would recommend targeting a specific niche of individuals who are likely to repay their loan to companies, such as Doctors. Doctors have a long educational process but are likely to make substantial money and usually work with high integrity, making them a very desirable niche market for personal loans.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    * As the company grows and expands its services, it also has more exposure for bad debt, so targeting a segmentation that is likely to pay back its loans is also time-poor and likely to take other product offerings.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    * Blockchain would be a good addition to the company technology, which would provide more transparency on the flow of money and leverage on the new technology trend, which is cryptocurrency. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    *   The increased adoption of blockchain technology will provide more leverage to the company and offer different growth opportunities.
